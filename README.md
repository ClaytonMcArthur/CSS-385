## Elavator Pitch
Do you enjoy 2D games? Do you like RPGs? Cipher of the Deep is a 2d top down RPG/Dungeon Crawler where your player can be a knight, mage, or rouge. As your player you will fight monsters, explore a dungeon, and conquer challenging bosses. As you navigate the dungeon you will find powerful gear, and be able to make your player stronger to face the final boss “The Dark Mage”. Cipher of the Deep is meant to be challenging and test your combat knowledge, challenge your navigation, and test your strategies.
## Game Synopsis
The player starts Cipher of the Deep by choosing to play as one of three classes: Knight, Mage, or Rougue. Once the player makes this descision; this will set large parts of the players experience for their run. Next the player will load into a dungeon where they can navigate said dungeon and find either enemies, loot, or doors. The player can progress through doors to find new areas of the dungeon. Once, the player progresses through enough areas they will find a boss. If the player is able to beat the boss a new giant area of the dungeon will be avaible for the player to explore kinda like a new level. In order for the player to be strong enough to beat bosses; they will have to kill monsters and loot chests to aquire new gear and levels. The run will conclude when the player reaches the final boss "The Dark Mage" which will be extremely challenging.
## Objectives

## Mechanics
The player will be able to control their player with WASD, once the player interacts with an enemy it will be turn based combat where the player can choose between a few attacks or defenses. Players will gain levels and gear once they defeat enemies or find loot in the dungeon.
