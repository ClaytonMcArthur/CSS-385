# Brainstorming

This game needs to use ASCII art style for as much as possible. I want to create a dungeon type feeling sort of like *The Binding of Isaac*, but the fights with monsters will mimic *Pokémon* with a separate fight screen. I want the fights to feel similar to *Pokémon* with simple characteristics like “fire is ineffective against skeletons”. I also want the player to be able to build their character in one of three paths: mage, knight, or assassin. The player will be able to find items on their way through the dungeon and pick different awards after killing monsters/bosses. The basic premise of the game will be levels that have a boss at the end. The final boss will be “The Dark Necromancer” which was the final boss in my original game.
