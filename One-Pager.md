#Progression and Rewards
-Game Example
Most RPGs have aspects of player progression, but I think Destiny and Destiny 2 show the best example of "Progression and Rewards". The Destiny franchise is all about building your characters level and gear so you as a player are able to unlock new activities and missions.

-Pros
1. Keeps players engaged
2. Always new game content to unlock
3. Keeps the game accessable for new and vetren players

-Cons
1. Games take a long time to reach end content
2. Can be daunting for casual players
3. Makes balancing in PvP challenging

-Use Cases
It is great to use player progression for games with lots of content and activities. It may not be practical to use for casual game such as Mario Cart, or games that are highly competitive PvP, like Call of Duty. While these games have small amounts of "Progression and Rewards" it is import to keep the player base balanced.

#Engaging Core Mechanics
-Game Example
A great example of "Engaging Core Mechanics" is Jump King. The developers spent time perfecting the jump for the character and polished all physics surrounding this action. The games is practically centered around this mechanic and this mechanic "feels good".

-Pros
1. Keeps the game simple for users
2. The core mechanic(s) are highly polished
3. Helps keep game objectives straightforward
   
-Cons
1. Game often lack complexity
2. Game can feel repetiative
3. Limits players interaction with the game world

-Use Cases
It is important to use polished mechanics for games with simple character movements and repetive action; like any Mario game or Silksong. Devs may have not as polished game mechanics in complex and large games like Red Dead Redemption 2 or PvP Call of Duty. While it is important for the player mechanics to work well the mechanics may not feel as polished as smaller games.

#Balance
-Game Example
A great example of "Balance" is Chess or CSGO. These games are highly competive where skill and knowledge are used to beat other playes, and not power/level in a game. Games like these are designed to pit players against each other and not time played or accesories/gear used.

-Pros
1. Keep games fair
2. Allow new players to vs vetren players
3. Keeps players engaged with stratigy
   
-Cons
1. Games can lack content
2. Games feel repetiative
3. Games may be to easy

-Use Cases
It is important to have game balance in competitve games like Apex Legends or Valorant. These games are designed to have players skill tested and do not offer unfair advatages for seasoned players in game. While games like Destiny or Terria are not as balanced because these games are designed to reward players that put in time to level up or gain new gear.
