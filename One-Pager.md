# Progression and Rewards

## -Game Example
Most RPGs have aspects of player progression, but Destiny and Destiny 2 exemplify "Progression and Rewards." The Destiny franchise focuses on building your character’s level and gear so you unlock new activities and missions.

## -Pros
1. Sustains engagement
2. Provides a steady stream of unlockable content
3. Keeps the game accessible for new and veteran players

## -Cons
1. Games take a long time to reach end content
2. Can be daunting for casual players
3. Makes balancing in PvP challenging

## -Use Cases
Use player progression for games with lots of content and activities. It may not be practical for casual games such as Mario Kart, or games that are highly competitive PvP, like Call of Duty. While these games include small amounts of "Progression and Rewards," it is important to keep the player base balanced.

# Engaging Core Mechanics

## -Game Example
A strong example of "Engaging Core Mechanics" is Jump King. The developers perfected the jump for the character and polished all physics surrounding this action. The game is centered around this mechanic, and this mechanic "feels good".

## -Pros
1. Keeps the game simple for users
2. The core mechanic(s) are highly polished
3. Helps keep game objectives straightforward

## -Cons
1. Games often lack complexity
2. Games can feel repetitive
3. Limits players’ interaction with the game world

## -Use Cases
Prioritize polished mechanics for games with simple character movement and repetitive action, like any Mario game or Silksong. Developers may have less polished mechanics in complex and large games like Red Dead Redemption 2 or PvP Call of Duty. While it is important for the player mechanics to work well, the mechanics may not feel as polished as in smaller games.

# Balance

## -Game Example
Balance is exemplified by Chess or CSGO. These games are highly competitive, where skill and knowledge are used to beat other players, not power/level in a game. Games like these are designed to pit players against each other—not time played or accessories/gear used.

## -Pros
1. Keeps games fair
2. Lets new players compete with veteran players
3. Keeps players engaged with strategy

## -Cons
1. Games can lack content
2. Games feel repetitive
3. Games may be too easy

## -Use Cases
It is important to have game balance in competitive games like Apex Legends or Valorant. These games are designed to test player skill and do not offer unfair advantages for seasoned players in-game. Games like Destiny or Terraria are not as balanced because they are designed to reward players who put in time to level up or gain new gear.
